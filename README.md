# bluesense-route

bluesense-route is a Python project designed to optimize routes and plan delivery waypoints using Streamlit and Azure Maps.

## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Calculate optimized routes between given points.
- **Waypoint Delivery**: Plan delivery waypoints and calculate optimized routes for multiple waypoints.
- **Weather Information**: Fetch and display current weather conditions for the route.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh

   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```

2. Use the sidebar to navigate between "Home", "Route optimization", and "Waypoint delivery".

### Configuration

The appearance of the Streamlit app can be customized using the `.streamlit/config.toml` file:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
backgroundColor = "#f79457"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#e0e0ef"
textColor = "#000000"
font = "sans serif"
